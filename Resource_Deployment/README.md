# Deployment Guide  
  
We are currently working on an automated deployment process for this solution accelerator. Until this becomes available, here is the Manual Deployment Guide for deploying this Solution Accelerator.  

## Step 1: Get the data required for this Accelerator 
We are using the data provided by [this Kaggle Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store), and you will need to download the data to your local machine. You will need the following CSVs/Datasets (download them):  
    - 2019-Oct.csv  
    - 2019-Nov.csv  
    - 2019-Dec.csv.gz (available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nan8X33H8xrXS5XhCKZmSpClFTCJsSpE))   
    - 2020-Jan.csv.gz (available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nan8X33H8xrXS5XhCKZmSpClFTCJsSpE))  


## Step 2: Create Azure Synapse Analytics
In this step you will deploy Azure Synapse Analytics and a Spark Pool in the Synapse workspace, an Azure Data Lake (Gen2) Storage Account, a Cosmos DB Account and an Azure Machine Learning Service into the Azure Subscription that you are using for this solution accelerator. 


**Parameters**

Below are parameters you will use to create the necessary resources for this solution accelerator. 
- **Subscription**: Azure Subscription Id 
- **Resource Group**: Name of the resource group to create 
- **Resource Name**: a globally unique name for creating the resources (must be 3-10 characters)
- **Username**: SQL user for Synapse workspace 
- **Password**: SQL user for Synapse workspace (must be at least 8 characters)
- **Location**: the location to deploy all the resources  
- **Directory Path**: the directory path where the dataset is located locally on your computer  
- **Cosmos DB Account Name**: the name of the Cosmos DB Account that will be used to store the User Recommendations and Product Details  


**Note:** You will be installing the Azure CLI extension for Azure Synapse 
1. Open Powershell as Administrator  
2. Navigate to this folder `Resource Deployment\deployment\backend\`  
3. Run the following command: 
    `./deployment_script.ps1`
4. Follow the prompts. 

### Deploy Azure Machine Learning
1. Once the above script finishes, go to the Azure Portal and deploy a Azure Machine Learning Services resource into the resource group that you are using for this Solution Accelerator.  
    - You can search for `Machine Learning` after clicking on `Create a resource` to get the correct resource.  
    - **NOTE**: Along with the service comes the following:  
        - Azure Key Vault  
        - Azure Storage  
        - Azure Application Insights  
        - Azure Container Registry (**ATTENTION**: The name of this service will be needed in the deployment of the Azure Kubernetes Service)  
            - You can find the name of the associated Container Registry in the resource page of the deployed Azure Machine Learning Service  

2. Now you will need to create a Service Principal and give Contributor access to the Azure Machine Learning Service. Run the following commands in the Powershell: 
- **Note**: Save the client-id and password of this Service Principal for future steps in the [Notebook](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/03_ALS_Model_Training.ipynb). This will install the Azure Machine Learning CLI Extention. 

```sh 
#After running the script, it will prompt you to login to the portal or enter a device code. 
az login

#Install the Azure Machine Learning CLI Extention 
az extension add -n azure-cli-ml

# Set the subscription you will be using for this solution accelerator
# NOTE: you will need to replace the following 
# - <subscription-id>
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>

# Create a Service Principal
# NOTE: you will need to replace the following 
# - <service-principal-name>: Desired name for the service principal
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --name <service-principal-name>

# Get details of your service principal 
# NOTE: you will need to replace the following
# - <client-id>: the client id from the previous step
az ad sp show --id <client-id> 

# Assign contributor role to the Azure Machine Learning Service 
# NOTE: you will need to replace the following
# - <workspace-name>: Azure Machine learning workspace name
# - <resource-group>: name of the resource group used for this solution accelerator 
# - <object-id>: the object id of the service principal 
az ml workspace share -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group> --user <object-id> --role contributor
```

### Step 2.1: Storage Account Permisions 
In order to read files from your Azure Storage Account from the Synapse workspace, you will need to grant `Storage Blob Data Contributor`. Follow the steps below to assign Storage Blob Data Contributor to the users. 
1. Go to the Azure Data Lake Storage Account created in Step 2
2. Go to the `Access Control (IAM)` 
3. Click `+ Add`
4. Click `Add role assignment` 
5. Now click the Role dropdown and select `Storage Blob Data Contributor` and search for your username and the other user's usernames to be added by using the search bar. 
6. Click `Save` at the bottom 
 
## Step 3: Upload Assets and Data to the Synapse Workspace 
### Step 3.1: Add IP address to Firewall
Before you can upload any assets to the Synapse Workspace you will first need to add your IP address to the Synapse Workspace. 
1. Go to the Synapse resouce you creaded in the previous step. 
2. Navigate to `Firewalls` under `Security` on the left hand side of the page.
3. At the top of the screen click `+ Add client IP`
   - ![Update Firewalls](./imgs/firewall.png)  
4. Your IP address should now be visible in the IP list. 

### Step 3.2: Upload Assets
1. Launch the Synapse workspace:  
    - Go to the resource page in the portal and click the "Launch Synapse Studio"
2. Go to `Develop`, click the `+`, and click Import:  
    - In the demo's repository, go to `Analytics Deployment\synapse-workspace\notebooks` to select all of the the Spark Notebooks  
3. Click Publish and confirm the assets to be published  
4. Go to the `Manage` tab in the Synapse workspace and click on the `Apache Spark pools` 
    - ![Spark Pool](./imgs/ManageSparkPool.png) 
6. Click `...` on the deployed Spark Pool and select `Packages`
7. Click `Upload` and select `requirements.txt` from the cloned repo. 
    - Go to `Analytics Deployment\synapse-workspace\cluster_config` to get the requirements.txt file for upload
8. Click `Apply` 
    - ![Requirements File](./imgs/Requirements.png)

## Step 4: Setting Up the Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Link  
### Create Containers for Recommendations and Product Details  
1. Go to the Cosmos DB service that was created in Step 2  

2. Go to the Data Explorer and create a database named `product_data` with the configurations below  
    - ![Add Database](./imgs/cdb_database.png)

3. Underneath the database, create two containers with the following configurations  
    - ![Add Container for Product Details](./imgs/cdb_prod_detail.png)  
    - ![Add Container for User Recommendations](./imgs/cdb_user_recs.png)
    - **NOTE**: In order to turn on `Analytical store` you need to Enable `Azure Synapse Link`
      -  ![Enable Link](./imgs/EnableLink.png)

4. Next, link your Cosmos DB to your Synapse workspace. Follow the directions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/how-to-connect-synapse-link-cosmos-db#connect-an-azure-cosmos-db-database-to-a-synapse-workspace)    
    - **NOTE**: Make sure to create a Linked Service in the Synapse workspace for the Cosmos DB connection and name it `retail_ai_cosmos_synapse_link`  

### Step 4.1: Upload Additional Dataset 
We use the [`product_detail.json`](../Analytics_Deployment/data/product_detail.json) to enhance the products served to the front-end with image information and cleaned up names.  

1. Upload this JSON to the Azure Data Lake Storage Account attached to your Synapse workspace
    - This file is located `/Analytics_Deployment/data`   
    - Make sure you put it into the filesystem that is the Primary Filesystem for the Synapse workspace  
    - Put it in the folder `synapse/workspaces` in the filesystem that is the primary filesystem for the Synapse workspace
2. Import [`Analytics_Deployment\synapse-workspace\notebooks\01_CreateOrUpdateProductDetails.ipynb`](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/01_CreateOrUpdateProductDetails.ipynb) to the Synapse workspace and fill out the parameters for the filesystem name and the account name  
3. Execute the Notebook  

## Step 5: Running of the Notebooks

1. Configure / Fill out the Parameters and then Run the following notebook in order:  
    - [`01_CreateOrUpdateProductDetails.ipynb`](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/01_CreateOrUpdateProductDetails.ipynb)
    - [`02_Clean_Training_Data.ipynb`](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/02_Clean_Training_Data.ipynb)  
    - [`03_ALS_Model_Training.ipynb`](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/03_ALS_Model_Training.ipynb)  
    - [`04_RecommendationRefresh.ipynb`](../Analytics_Deployment/synapse-workspace/notebooks/04_RecommendationRefresh.ipynb)
    
2. After all of these have been run successfully, the recommendations will have been generated for the User-Based Recommendations, and the model will be ready for deployment for the Item-Based Recommender served on Azure Kubernetes Service.  
  
## Step 6: Set Up the Item-Based Recommendation Web Service  
> In this section we will set up the Item-Based Recommendation Web Service by using Azure Machine Learning Service to package and deploy the model and Azure Kubernetes Service to host the model. 

> You will need Python 3.7+ installed on your local machine.
 
1. Launch the Azure Machine Learning Studio: 
    - Go to the resource page in the portal and click the "Launch Studio" 
2. Go to "Compute", click "Inference Clusters" and click "+ New": 
    - fill in the Compute Name, Region, choose the Dev-test or Production for the cluster purpose and select Create

3. In the repository on your local machine, open `Analytics Deployment\amls\model_deployment\` in an IDE like VS Code  
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
5. Edit the `download_model.py` file:  
    -  In the file `download_model.py`, edit the following:  
        ```python
        # Enter the name of the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Account
        DATA_LAKE_NAME=""
        # Enter the name of the filesystem
        DATA_LAKE_FILE_SYSTEM_NAME=""
        # Enter the Primary Key of the Data Lake Account
        DATA_LAKE_PRIMARY_KEY=""
        ```  
    - Now run `python download_model.py`  
        - This should create a ZIP of the model on your local machine.  
6. Before deploying the model, edit the `score.py` file and the `deploy_model.py` file.  
    - `score.py` at the top of the file in the `init()` function:   
        ```python
        def init():
            ## Add in your Data Lake Details Here
            
            ## The DATA_LAKE_NAME should be the attached Data Lake to your Synapse workspace where the saved ALS Model is
            DATA_LAKE_NAME=""
            ## DATA_LAKE_FILE_SYSTEM_NAME should be the filesystem that is attached to the Synapse workspace where the Model is saved
            DATA_LAKE_FILE_SYSTEM_NAME=""
            ## DATA_LAKE_PRIMARY_KEY is the Primary Key of the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 that can be found in the portal
            DATA_LAKE_PRIMARY_KEY=""
        ```  
    - `deploy_model.py`  
        ```python
        # Subscription ID for the Solution Accelerator
        SUBSCRIPTION_ID=""
        # Resource Group that you are using for the Solution Accelerator
        RESOURCE_GROUP=""
        # Found in the output of the Service Principal created earlier
        TENANT_ID=""
        # Found in the output of the Service Principal created earlier
        APP_ID=""
        # Found in the output of the Service Principal created earlier
        SP_PASSWORD=""
        # Name of the Azure Machine Learning Service that you deployed
        WORKSPACE_NAME=""
        # Name of the Azure Kubernetes Service that you deployed
        AKS_CLUSTER_NAME=""
        ```  
7. Now run `python deploy_model.py` and the model will be registered with AMLS and deployed to the AKS cluster  
    
## Step 7: Setting Up the API Infrastructure  
### Set Up Azure API Management  
1. Navigate to the [Application_Backend_Deployment](../Application_Backend_Deployment/README.md) and follow the steps to deploy the API endpoints.
2. Deploy Azure API Management in the resource group that you are using for this Solution Accelerator  
2. In the Azure API Management, go to `APIs` and choose `Blank API` 
4. Configure the name of your API and click Create  

> Now you are ready to integrate the API with your front-end by utilizing the API you built in Azure API Management.  
  
#### Example Recommendation Call  

```https://{ENTER_YOUR_APIM_NAME}.net/{VERSION_NUM_OF_API}/get_shopper_recommendations?subscription-key={APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}&user_id=568778435```

# Step 8: Setting Up the Event Hub 
1. Run the following commands in Powershell to deploy an Event Hub Namespace and Event Hub into the resource group you are using for this solution accelerator. 

    ```sh 
    # Set your Azure subscription to the subscription used in this solution accelerator
    
    # NOTE: you will need to replace the following: 
    # - <Subscription-Id>
    az account set --subscription <Subscription-Id>

    # Create Event Hub namespace 

    # NOTE: you will need to replace the following: 
    # - <event-hub-namespace>, <resource-group>, <location>
    az eventhubs namespace create --name <event-hub-namespace> --resource-group <resource-group> -l <location>

    # Create Event Hub called clickthrough

    # NOTE: you will need to replace the following: 
    # - <resource-group>, <event-hub-namespace>
    az eventhubs eventhub create --name clickthrough --resource-group <resource-group> --namespace-name <event-hub-namespace>
    ```
2. Navigate to the Event Hub Overview in the Azure portal
    - From the Overview, go to `Event Hubs`, click the `clickthrough` Event Hub created in the previous step
    - Click `Capture events` to turn on and configure the settings to send events to the storage account you are using for this solution accelerator.  
3. Navigate to the `clickthrough` Event Hub and click `Shared access policies`, click "+ Add" and configure a new policy and click `send`. 
    - Click `Create`
4. Navigate to the [Application_Frontend_Deployment/contoso-retail/src/config.ts](../Application_Frontend_Deployment/contoso-retail/src/config.ts) to add the `EVENT_HUB_ACCESS_KEY`, `EVENT_HUB_KEYNAME`, and `EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE` created in the previous steps to the application.
